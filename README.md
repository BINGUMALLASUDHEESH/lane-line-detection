# lane-line-detection

Detecting Lane lines is one of the most fundamental concepts for building a Self Driving Car. In this repository, I have used OpenCV to detect lane lines in a sample video sample obtained from a camera places on a car.

You need OpenCV to run this project on your local machine and it can be installed simply by a single command -
pip install opencv-python
